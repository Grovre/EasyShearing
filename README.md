# EasyShearing
This spigot plugin makes shearing a lot of sheep completely painless. Less is more, so here's what it does: All sheep within a specified radius around a sheep currently being sheared will be sheared as well.
Everything about this plugin is configurable, even the shears taking extra damage for all of the sheep (if you want that). Makes having sheep much more maintainable
